## Box Breathing

3. Breathe out for four seconds
4. Hold for four seconds

"'Box breathing' or 'tactical breathing' ... is characterized by equal inhale and hold and exhale ratios and has been used by members of the military for stress regulation and performance improvement" (Balban et al. 2023).

Potential other visual here is a literal box

## Physiological Sighing
1. Two sharp inhales
2. Long exhale, as if sighing

"'Sighing,' characterized by deep breaths followed by extended, relatively longer exhales, has been associated with psychological relief, shifts in autonomic states, and resetting of respiratory rate" (Balban et al. 2023).

"[A] 5-minute walk every 30 minutes could offset the effects of prolonged sitting" (5-minute walks every 30 minutes may offset effects of too much sitting, 2023)

## Stand Up and Stretch

"According to empirical investigations, physical activity is positively associated with certain mental health traits. In nonclinical investigations, the most significant effects of physical exercise have been on self-concept and body image" (Mahindru et al., 2023)
