## Physiological Sighing
1. Two sharp inhales
2. Long exhale, as if sighing

"'Sighing,' characterized by deep breaths followed by extended, relatively longer exhales, has been associated with psychological relief, shifts in autonomic states, and resetting of respiratory rate" (Balban et al. 2023).
